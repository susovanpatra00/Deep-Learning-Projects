# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing images of dogs and cats, and it learns to distinguish between the two classes.

## Overview

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and deep learning. It consists of thousands of images of dogs and cats, which are labeled with their respective categories. The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify images as either dogs or cats.

## Dataset

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). It contains a large number of images of dogs and cats, which are labeled as either 'dog' or 'cat'.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** The images are loaded from the dataset directory and preprocessed for training. They are resized to a fixed size, normalized, and augmented using data augmentation techniques.

2. **Model Creation:** The CNN model is created using the Sequential API of TensorFlow Keras. It comprises convolutional layers followed by batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout layers.

3. **Training:** The model is trained on the training dataset using the fit() function. The training process involves iterating over multiple epochs and updating the model parameters to minimize the loss.

4. **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the validation dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are computed to measure the model's effectiveness.

5. **Visualization:** The training and validation accuracy/loss curves are plotted to visualize the model's performance during training.

## Results

The CNN model achieves a significant accuracy on the validation dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify images of dogs and cats accurately. The model's performance can be further analyzed using confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics.
